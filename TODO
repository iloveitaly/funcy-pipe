- [ ] `to_list` is unnecessary here `return payment_intents | fp.where_attr(status= "succeeded") | fp.to_list() |fp.sample()`
- [ ] need some sort of exists(): `paid_ticket_orders | fp.pluck("stripe_payment_intent_id") | fp.compact()`
- [ ] use new python package template
- [ ] https://github.com/Suor/funcy/issues/148
- [ ] there are some duplicate methods in __init__ that should be removed now that we have extensions
- [ ] automated documentation?
- [ ] maybe support chaining as well
- [ ] should `identity` and `constantly` be omitted?
- [ ] maybe support chaining as well
- [ ] PipeFirst == PipeSecond when a function only has a single arg. Maybe we should inspect this case and set it up dynamically?
        # TODO should have some addition to handle this
        | fp.pluck("subject") | fp.pluck("url")
