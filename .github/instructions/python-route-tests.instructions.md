## Python Route Tests

- Polyfactory is the [factory](tests/factories.py) library in use. `ModelNameFactory.build()` is how you generate factories.
- Use `assert_status(response)` instead of `assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK`
- Do not reference routes by raw strings. Instead of `client.get("/the/route/path")` use `client.get(api_app.url_path_for("route_method_name"))`
